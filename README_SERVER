All complexity of the project is handled in the server with minimum dependency 
on the client to function

There are 3 types of server
1.server.cpp
	This handles the first part of server implementation.
2.server_select.cpp
	This include select().
3.server_thread.cpp
	Multithreading is taken care here

calendar.cpp is the data structure taking care of the all the information

calendar.h is the interface details of the data structure and is included in all the files

--------------------------------------------------------------
To start the server :
$ make
$ cd bin

and one of the following 3 commands accordingly
$./server PORT_NO
$./server_select PORT_NO
$./select_thread PORT_NO
